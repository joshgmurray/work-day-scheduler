# Work Day Scheduler
## Challenge Description
For this challenge I was asked to create a work day scheduler that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.  
## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
## Work Completed
* Added current up to date time to scheduler
* Added sections for each hour of the day that switch to "event has already happened" when the hour passes
* Added styling to show what the current hour of the day is
* Created a save button for every event 
* Added text boxes for upcoming events to customize specifics
